excerpt: 'As Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies become increasingly prevalent in Natural Language Processing (NLP), ensuring their responsible and inclusive development is crucial. This scoping literature review analyzes interdisciplinary scholarship across human-computer interaction (HCI), and computational and sociolinguistics, encompassing 44 key papers. We identify significant discussions within these fields on the challenges of inclusivity in NLP and ASR, particularly on how biases in design, data practices, and implementation affect ethnically and linguistically diverse groups such as African-American English (AAE) speakers. Our analysis provides a foundational understanding of the current discourse and outlines future research directions to develop NLP technologies that are socially affirming and inclusive. This paper concludes with strategic considerations for shifting paradigms in the development of ASR and NLP systems, emphasizing the roles of responsible NLP practitioners in addressing trustworthy AI, power dynamics, harmful linguistic ideologies, and advocating for linguistic justice.'
