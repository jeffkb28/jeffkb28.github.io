I am a third-year Ph.D. student and [GEM Fellow](https://www.gemfellowship.org/gem-fellowship-program/) in the Department of **Human-Centered Design and Engineering** at the **University of Washington**, specializing in **Human-Computer Interaction** with a focus on **AI fairness**. I am a member of the [Tactile and Tactical (TAT) Design Lab](https://tat-lab.github.io/), under the guidance of [Dr. Daniela Rosner](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/rosner), and the [Wildlab](https://wildlab.cs.washington.edu/), where I am also advised by [Dr. Katharina Reinecke](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/reinecke). My work across these labs focuses on exploring **design, technology, and social impact** through interdisciplinary research.

I am deeply invested in promoting responsible AI/ML systems that prioritize **fairness**, **inclusivity**, and **equity**. My research investigates the sociotechnical implications of **race** and **culture** especially in how **intelligent systems** and **automated language technologies** interact with underrepresented communities. Leveraging **inclusive design** and **justice-driven frameworks**, I aim to enhance user experiences with a particular emphasis on **Black American communities**.

<!--
In addition to my academic pursuits, I serve as a board member of [Acquiring Knowledge for Transcendence](https://www.aktcommunity.org/) and design team lead at [A Vision for Engineering Literacy and Access](http://students.washington.edu/avelauw/index.html), both nonprofit organizations dedicated to supporting underrepresented youth in education. My career goal is to establish a research lab that addresses **social disparities in tech design**, ultimately contributing to **data-driven solutions** that mitigate **racial biases** and amplify **diverse voices** within intelligent systems.

**Bridging Sociolects and AI: Assessing User Interaction with Sociolectally Adapted Large Language Models**

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily communication, it is crucial that they understand and utilize sociolects appropriately. This study presents a quantitative experiment in which LLMs are fine-tuned to generate text in specific sociolects, including African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and Queer Slang. Participants engage with these LLMs through tasks such as video summarization and topic discussions, allowing us to measure key factors such as user trust, cultural sensitivity, and confidence. Our research examines the impact of sociolectal adaptation on AI perception, focusing on user satisfaction, frustration, trust, perceived social proximity, and reliance
