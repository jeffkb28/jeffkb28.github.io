I am a third-year Ph.D. student in **Human-Centered Design and Engineering** at the **University of Washington**, specializing in **Human-Computer Interaction** with a focus on **AI/ML fairness**. I am deeply invested in promoting **responsible AI/ML systems** that prioritize **fairness**, **inclusivity**, and **equity**.

My research investigates the sociotechnical implications of **race**, **culture**, **identity**, and **power**, especially in how **intelligent systems** and **automated language technologies** interact with underrepresented communities. Leveraging **inclusive design** and **justice-driven frameworks**, I aim to enhance user experiences with a particular emphasis on **Black American communities**. Through **community collaboration** and **equity-centered methods**, I seek to advance sustainable design practices that foster authentic, inclusive technology.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I serve as a board member of **Acquiring Knowledge for Transcendence** and **Design Team Lead** at **A Vision for Engineering Literacy and Access**, both nonprofit organizations dedicated to supporting underrepresented youth in education. My career goal is to establish a research lab that addresses **social disparities in tech design**, ultimately contributing to **data-driven solutions** that mitigate **racial biases** and amplify **diverse voices** within intelligent systems.

Bridging Sociolects and AI: Assessing User Interaction with Sociolectally Adapted Large Language Models

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily communication, it is crucial that they understand and utilize sociolects appropriately. This study presents a quantitative experiment in which LLMs are fine-tuned to generate text in specific sociolects, including African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and Queer Slang. Participants engage with these LLMs through tasks such as video summarization and topic discussions, allowing us to measure key factors such as user trust, cultural sensitivity, and confidence. Our research examines the impact of sociolectal adaptation on AI perception, focusing on user satisfaction, frustration, trust, perceived social proximity, and reliance
